    .SYNOPSIS
        Configure a downstream WSUS replica server behind a proxy.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This configuration installs and configures a WSUS server as a replica of
        an upstream WSUS server, synchronizing through an authenticating proxy.

        A replica server inherits its languages, products, classifications and
        approvals from its upstream server, so those settings are not specified
        here. Update binaries are fetched from Microsoft Update rather than from
        the upstream server, to keep traffic off the link between the two.

    .PARAMETER SetupCredential
        Credential used to perform the initial WSUS post-installation configuration.

    .PARAMETER ProxyServerCredential
        Credential used to authenticate to the proxy server.
